Don Quixote;Miguel de Cervantes;In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his best homespun.;1;
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland;Lewis Carroll;Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, Ôand what is the use of a book,Õ thought Alice Ôwithout pictures or conversation?Õ So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.;1;
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn;Mark Twain;"You donÕt know about me, without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ainÕt no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt PollyÑTomÕs Aunt Polly, she isÑand Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a 1 book, with some stretchers, as I said before.";1;
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer;Mark Twain;"The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or never lookedÊthroughÊthem for so small a thing as a boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for Òstyle,Ó not serviceÑshe could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well. She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the furniture to hear";1;
Treasure Island;Robert Louis Stevenson;Quire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I take up my pen in the year of grace 17__ and go back to the time when my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof.;1;
Pride and Prejudice;Jane Austen;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. ÒMy dear Mr. Bennet,Ó said his lady to him one day, Òhave you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?Ó Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.;0;
Wuthering Heights;Emily Bront‘;I have just returned from a visit to my landlordÑthe solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropistÕs HeavenÑand Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us.;0;
Jane Eyre;Charlotte Bront‘;"There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the question.";0;
Moby Dick;Herman Melville;"Call me Ishmael. Some years agoÑnever mind how long preciselyÑhaving little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses";1;
The Scarlet Letter;Nathaniel Hawthorne;ItÊis a little remarkable, thatÑthough disinclined to talk overmuch of myself and my affairs at the fireside, and to my personal friendsÑan autobiographical impulse should twice in my life have taken possession of me, in addressing the public. The first time was three or four years since, when I favored the readerÑinexcusably, and for no earthly reason, that either the indulgent reader or the intrusive author could imagine.;1;
Gulliver's Travels;Jonathan Swift;"My father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire; I was the third of five sons. He sent me to Emanuel College in Cambridge at fourteen years old, where I resided three years, and applied myself close to my studies; but the charge of maintaining me, although I had a very scanty allowance, being too great for a narrow fortune, I was bound apprentice to Mr. James Bates, an eminent surgeon in London";1;
The Pilgrim's Progress;John Bunyan;As I walked through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on a certain place where was a Den, and I laid me down in that place to sleep: and, as I slept, I dreamed a dream.

A Christmas Carol;Charles Dickens;MarleyÊwas dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and ScroogeÕs name was good upon ÕChange, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.;1;
David Copperfield;Charles Dickens;Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show.

It was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry, simultaneously.;1;
A Tale of Two Cities;Charles Dickens;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us;1;
Little Women;Louisa May Alcott;"""Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,"" grumbled Jo, lying on the rug. ""It's so dreadful to be poor!"" sighed Meg, looking down at her old dress.

""We've got father and mother and each other,"" said Beth contentedly, from her corner.";0;
Great Expectations;Charles Dickens;My fatherÕs family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.;1;
The Hobbit, or, There and Back Again;J.R.R. Tolkien;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.;1;
Frankenstein, or, the Modern Prometheus;Mary Shelley;I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic.

He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business.;0;
Oliver Twist;Charles Dickens;"Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns, great or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on a day and date which I need not trouble myself";1;
Uncle Tom's Cabin;Harriet Beecher Stowe;Late in the afternoon of a chilly day in February, two gentlemen were sitting alone over their wine, in a well-furnished dining parlor, in the town of PÑÑ, in Kentucky.

The Return of the King;J.R.R. Tolkien;Pippin looked out from the shelter of GandalfÕs cloak.

Dracula;Bram Stoker;"Left Munich at 8:35ÊP. M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late.

The Three Musketeers;Alexandre Dumas;OnÊthe first Monday of the month of April, 1625, the market town of Meung, in which the author ofÊRomance of the RoseÊwas born, appeared to be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the Huguenots had just made a second La Rochelle of it.

To Kill a Mockingbird;Harper Lee;"When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow.

The Wizard of Oz;L. Frank Baum;"Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmerÕs wife.

The Secret Garden;Frances Hodgson Burnett;When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle everybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen. It was 1, too.

Animal Farm;George Orwell;Mr. Jones, of the Manor Farm, had locked the hen-houses for the night, but was too drunk to remember to shut the popholes. With the ring of light from his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched across the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door;1;
The Great Gatsby;F. Scott Fitzgerald;In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that IÕve been turning over in my mind ever since.

The Little Prince;Antoine de Saint-ExupŽry;Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called 1 Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.;1;
The Call of the Wild;Jack London;Buck's  first day on the Dyea beach was like a nightmare. Every hour was filled with shock and surprise.

Clan of the Cave Bear;Jean M. Auel;The naked child ran out of the hide-covered lean-to toward the rocky beach at the bend in the small river. It didnÕt occur to her to look back.

Bleak House;Charles Dickens;London. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather.

The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling;Henry Fielding;"An author ought to consider himself, not as a gentleman who gives a private or eleemosynary treat, but rather as one who keeps a public ordinary, at which all persons are welcome for their money. In the former case, it is well known that the entertainer provides what fare he pleases; and though this should be very indifferent, and utterly disagreeable to the taste of his company, they must not find any fault; nay, on the contrary, good breeding forces them outwardly to approve and to commend whatever is set before them.

The Hound of the Baskervilles;Arthur Conan Doyle;Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated at the breakfast table.

The Two Towers;J.R.R. Tolkien;Aragorn sped on up the hill. Every now and again he bent to the ground. Hobbits go light, and their footprints are not easy even for a Ranger to read, but not far from the top a spring crossed the path, and in the wet earth he saw what he was seeking.;1;
The War of the Worlds;H.G. Wells;"No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than manÕs and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.";1;
Middlemarch;George Eliot;"Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into relief by poor dress.

The Color Purple;Alice Walker;Whatever else The Color Purple has been taken for during the years since its publication, it remains for me the theological  work examining the journey from the religious back to the spiritual that I spent much of my adult life, prior to writing it,  seeking to avoid.

Northanger Abbey;Jane Austen;No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be an heroine.

I had just gotten over a serious illness that I wonÕt bother to talk about, except that it had something to do with the miserably weary split-up and my feeling that everything was dead.

Before that IÕd often dreamed of going West to see the country, always vaguely planning and never taking off.;1;
Catch-22;Joseph Heller;It was love at first sight. The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.

The Sun Also Rises;Ernest Hemingway;Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton. Do not think that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it meant a lot to Cohn.

Outside the brush house in the tuna clump, a covey of little birds chittered and flurried with their wings.;1;
Ethan Frome;Edith Wharton;The village lay under two feet of snow, with drifts at the windy corners. In a sky of iron the points of the Dipper hung like icicles and Orion flashed his cold fires.
