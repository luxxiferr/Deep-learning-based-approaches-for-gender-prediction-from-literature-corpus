The Red & the Black;Stendhal;The little town of Verrires can pass for one of the prettiest in Franche-ComtŽ. Its white houses with their pointed red-tiled roofs stretch along the slope of a hill, whose slightest undulations are marked by groups of vigorous chestnuts. The Doubs flows to within some hundred feet above its fortifications, which were built long ago by the Spaniards, and are now in ruins.;1
The Stranger;Albert Camus;"Mother died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I canÕt be sure. The telegram from the Home says: your MOTHER PASSED AWAY. FUNERAL TOMORROW. DEEP sympathy. Which leaves the matter doubtful; it could have been yesterda";1
The Trial;Franz Kafka;Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K., he knew he had done nothing wrong but, one morning, he was arrested. Every day at eight in the morning he was brought his breakfast by Mrs. Grubach's cookÑMrs. Grubach was his landladyÑbut today she didn't come. That had never happened before. K. waited a little while, looked from his pillow at the old woman who lived opposite and who was watching him with an inquisitiveness quite unusual for her, and finally, both hungry and disconcerted, rang the bell.Ê;1
Lady Chatterley's Lover;D.H. Lawrence;Ours is essentially a tragic age, so we refuse to take it tragically. The cataclysm has happened, we are among the ruins, we start to build up new little habitats, to have new little hopes. It is rather hard work: there is now no smooth road into the future: but we go round, or scramble over the obstacles. We've got to live, no matter how many skies have fallen.;1
Kidnapped: The Adventures of David Balfour;Robert Louis Stevenson;"I will begin the story of my adventures with a certain morning early in the month of June, the year of grace 1751, when I took the key for the last time out of the door of my fatherÕs house. The sun began to shine upon the summit of the hills as I went down the road; and by the time I had come as far as the manse, the blackbirds were whistling in the garden lilacs, and the mist that hung around the valley in the time of the dawn was beginning to arise and die away.";1
The Catcher in the Rye;J.D. Salinger;If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born, an what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them.;1
Fahrenheit 451;Ray Bradbury;IT WAS A PLEASURE TO BURN. IT was a special pleasure to see things eaten, to see things blackened and changed. With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history.;1
A Journey to the Center of the Earth;Jules Verne;Looking back to all that has occurred to me since that eventful day, I am scarcely able to believe in the reality of my adventures. They were truly so wonderful that even now I am bewildered when I think of them.;1
Gone with the Wind;Margaret Mitchell;Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom realized it when caught by her charm as the Tarleton twins were. In her face were too sharply blended the delicate features of her mother, a Coast aristocrat of French descent, and the heavy ones of her florid Irish father. But it was an arresting face, pointed of chin, square of jaw.;0
My çntonia;Willa Cather;LAST summer I happened to be crossing the plains of Iowa in a season of intense heat, and it was my good fortune to have for a traveling companion James Quayle Burden--Jim Burden, as we still call him in the West. He and I are old friends--we grew up together in the same Nebraska town--and we had much to say to each other. While the train flashed through neverending miles of ripe wheat, by country towns and bright-flowered pastures and oak groves wilting in the sun, we sat in the observation car;0
Of Mice and Men;John Steinbeck;A FEW MILES south of Soledad, the Salinas River drops in close to the hillside bank and runs deep and green. The water is warm too, for it has slipped twinkling over the yellow sands in the sunlight before reaching the narrow pool. On one side of the river the golden foothill slopes curve up to the strong and rocky Gabilan mountains;1
The Vicar of Wakefield;Oliver Goldsmith;I was ever of opinion, that the honest man who married and brought up a large family, did more service than he who continued single, and only talked of population. From this motive, I had scarce taken orders a year before I began to think seriously of matrimony, and chose my wife as she did her wedding gown, not for a fine glossy surface, but such qualities as would wear well.;1
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court;Mark Twain;ÒCamelotÑCamelot,Ó said I to myself. ÒI donÕt seem to remember hearing of it before. Name of the asylum, likely.Ó It was a soft, reposeful summer landscape, as lovely as a dream, and as lonesome as Sunday. The air was full of the smell of flowers, and the buzzing of insects, and the twittering of birds, and there were no people, no wagons, there was no stir of life, nothing going on.;1
White Fang;Jack London;"Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees 
had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and 
they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading 
light. A vast silence reigned over the land. ";1
Fathers and Sons;Ivan Sergeevich Turgenev;"In this masterly unromantic novel, Turgenev drew a character, Bazarov, who served to express what he taught us to call Nihilism, and made a movement into a man. In Russia itself the effect of the story was astonishing. The portrait of Bazarov was immediately and angrily resented as a cold travesty. The portraits of the ""backwoodsmen,"" or retired aristocrats, fared no better. Turgenev had indeed roused the ire of both sides, only too surely.";1
Doctor Zhivago;Boris Leonidovich Pasternak;They walked and walked and sang ÒMemory Eternal,Ó1 and whenever they stopped, the singing seemed to be carried on by their feet, the horses, the gusts of wind.;1
The Decameron;Giovanni Boccaccio;As often, most gracious ladies, as, taking thought in myself, I mind me how very pitiful you are all by nature, so often do I recognize that this present work will, to your thinking, have a grievous and a weariful beginning, inasmuch as the dolorous remembrance of the late pestiferous mortality, which it beareth on its forefront, is universally irksome to all who saw or otherwise knew it.;1
Nineteen Eighty-Four;George Orwell;It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.;1
The Jungle;Upton Sinclair;"It was four o'clock when the ceremony was over and the carriages began to arrive. There had been a crowd following all the way, owing to the exuberance of Marija Berczynskas. The occasion rested heavily upon Marija's broad shoulders--it was her task to see that all things went in due form, and after the best home traditions; and, flying wildly hither and thither, bowling every one out of the way, and scolding and exhorting all day with her tremendous voice, Marija was too eager to see that others conformed to the proprieties to consider them herself.";1
The Da Vinci Code;Dan Brown;Renowned curator Jacques Sauniere staggered through the vaulted archway of the museum's Grand  Gallery. He lunged for the nearest painting he could see, a Caravaggio. Grabbing the gilded frame,  the seventy-six-year-old man heaved the masterpiece toward himself until it tore from the wall and  Sauniere collapsed backward in a heap beneath the canvas.;1
Persuasion;Jane Austen;"Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century";0
Mansfield Park;Jane Austen;About thirty years ago Miss Maria Ward, of Huntingdon, with only seven thousand pounds, had the good luck to captivate Sir Thomas Bertram, of Mansfield Park, in the county of Northampton, and to be thereby raised to the rank of a baronetÕs lady, with all the comforts and consequences of an handsome house and large income.;0
Ronia;Astrid Lindgren;ON THE NIGHT THAT RONIA WAS BORN A THUNDERSTORM WAS RAGING over the mountains, such a storm that all the goblinfolk in MattÕs Forest crept back in terror to their holes and hiding places. Only the fierce harpies preferred stormy weather to any other;0
Mary Poppins;P. L. Travers;If you want to find Cherry-Tree Lane all you have to do is ask the Policeman at the cross-roads. He will push his helmet slightly to one side, scratch his head thoughtfully, and the he will point his huge white-gloved finger.;0
The Golden Notebook;Doris Lessing;Anna meets her friend Molly in the summer of 1957 after a separation. THE two women were alone in the London flat. 'The point is,' said Anna, as her friend came back  from the telephone on the landing, 'the point is, that as far as I can see, everything's cracking up.' ;0
The Hearts Is a Lonely Hunter;Carson McCullers;In the town there were two mutes,and they were always together. Earlyevery morning they would came outfrom the house where they lived andwalk arm in arm down theÊstreet to work.;0
On Self-Respect;Joan Didion;"Once, in a dry season, I wrote in large letters across two pages of a notebook that 
innocence ends when one is stripped of the delusion that one likes oneself. Although 
now, some years later, I marvel that a mind on the outs with itself should have 
nonetheless made painstaking record of its every tremor";0
North and South;Elizabeth Gaskell;ÒEdith!Ó said Margaret, gently, ÒEdith!Ó But as Margaret half suspected, Edith had fallen asleep. She lay curled up on the sofa in the back drawing-room in Harley Street looking very lovely in her white muslin and blue ribbons.;0
Stories of Eva Luna;Isabel Allende;You took off your waistband, you tore off your sandals, you pulled your wide skirt, cotton, to one corner, it seems to me, and you let go the knot that held your hair in a tail. You had bristling skin and you laughed. We were so close that we could not see each other, both absorbed in that urgent rite, wrapped in the heat and the smell we were doing together.;0
Silent Spring;Rachel Carson;THERE WAS ONCE a town in the heart of America where all life seemed to live in harmony with its surroundings. The town lay in the midst of a checkerboard of prosperous farms, with fields of grain and hillsides of orchards where, in spring, white clouds of bloom drifted above the green fields.;0
Tiger Eyes;Judy Blume;It is the morning of the funeral and I am tearing my room apart, trying to find the right kind of shoes to wear. But all I come up with are my Adidas, which have holes in the toes.;0
Adventures of the Wishing Chair;Enid Blyton;The adventures really began on the day that Mollie and Peter went out to spend thirty-five pence on a present for their mother's birthday.;0
The God of Small Things;Arundhati Roy;May in Ayemenem is a hot, brooding month. The days are long and humid. The river shrinks and black crows gorge on bright mangoes in still, dustgreen trees. Red bananas ripen. Jackfruits burst. Dissolute bluebottles hum vacuously in the fruity air. Then they stun themselves against clear windowpanes and die, fatly baffled in the sun.;0
The Bell;Iris Murdoch;Dora Greenfield left her husband because she was afraid of him. She decided six months later to return to him for the same reason. The absent Paul, haunting her with letters and telephone bells and imagined footsteps on the stairs had begun to be the greater torment. Dora suffered from guilt, and with guilt came fear.Ê;0

Complete Stories;Dorothy Parker;Mr.Wheelock was clipping the hedge. He did not dislike doing it. If it had not been for the faintly sickish odor of the privet bloom, he would definitely have enjoyed it.;0
The Poisonwood Bible;Barbara Kingsolver;IMAGINE A RUIN so strange it must never have happened. First, picture the forest. I want you to be its conscience, the eyes in the trees. The trees are columns of slick, brindled bark like muscular animals overgrown beyond all reason. Every space is filled with life: delicate, poisonous frogs war-painted like skeletons, clutched in copulation;0
The Optimist's Daughter;Eudora Welty;A nurse held the door open for them. Judge McKelva going first, then his daughter Laurel, then his wife Fay, they walked into the window-less room where the doctor would make his examination.;0
Henry and June;Ana•s Nin;A book collector offered Henry Miller a hundred dollars a month to write erotic stories. It seemed like a Dantesque punishment to condemn Henry to write erotica at a dollar a page.;0
The Children of Men;P. D. James;Early this morning, 1 January 2021, three minutes after midnight, the last human being to be born on earth was killed in a pub brawl in a suburb of Buenos Aires, aged twenty-five years, two months and twelve days.;0
