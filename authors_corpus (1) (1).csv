Don Quixote;Miguel de Cervantes;In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his best homespun.;TRUE
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland;Lewis Carroll;Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, ‘and what is the use of a book,’ thought Alice ‘without pictures or conversation?’ So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.;TRUE
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn;Mark Twain;"You don’t know about me, without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain’t no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly—Tom’s Aunt Polly, she is—and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.";TRUE
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer;Mark Twain;"The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or never looked through them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for “style,” not service—she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well. She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the furniture to hear";TRUE
Treasure Island;Robert Louis Stevenson;Quire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I take up my pen in the year of grace 17__ and go back to the time when my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof.;TRUE
Pride and Prejudice;Jane Austen;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. “My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?” Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.;FALSE
Wuthering Heights;Emily Brontë;I have just returned from a visit to my landlord—the solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country!

Jane Eyre;Charlotte Brontë;"There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the question.";FALSE
Moby Dick;Herman Melville;"Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.

Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses";TRUE
The Scarlet Letter;Nathaniel Hawthorne;It is a little remarkable, that—though disinclined to talk overmuch of myself and my affairs at the fireside, and to my personal friends—an autobiographical impulse should twice in my life have taken possession of me, in addressing the public. The first time was three or four years since, when I favored the reader—inexcusably, and for no earthly reason, that either the indulgent reader or the intrusive author could imagine.;TRUE
Gulliver's Travels;Jonathan Swift;"My father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire; I was the third of five sons.

A Christmas Carol;Charles Dickens;Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge’s name was good upon ’Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.;TRUE
David Copperfield;Charles Dickens;Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show.

It was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry, simultaneously.;TRUE
A Tale of Two Cities;Charles Dickens;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us;TRUE
Little Women;Louisa May Alcott;"""Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,"" grumbled Jo, lying on the rug. ""It's so dreadful to be poor!"" sighed Meg, looking down at her old dress.

Frankenstein, or, the Modern Prometheus;Mary Shelley;I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic.

Dracula;Bram Stoker;"Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late.

To Kill a Mockingbird;Harper Lee;"When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow.

The Secret Garden;Frances Hodgson Burnett;When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle everybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen.

Animal Farm;George Orwell;Mr. Jones, of the Manor Farm, had locked the hen-houses for the night, but was too drunk to remember to shut the popholes. With the ring of light from his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched across the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door;TRUE

20,000 Leagues Under the Sea;Jules Verne;The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten.

Fathers and Sons;Ivan Sergeevich Turgenev;"In this masterly unromantic novel, Turgenev drew a character, Bazarov, who served to express what he taught us to call Nihilism, and made a movement into a man. In Russia itself the effect of the story was astonishing. The portrait of Bazarov was immediately and angrily resented as a cold travesty.

There had been a crowd following all the way, owing to the exuberance of Marija Berczynskas. The occasion rested heavily upon Marija's broad shoulders--it was her task to see that all things went in due form, and after the best home traditions; and, flying wildly hither and thither, bowling every one out of the way, and scolding and exhorting all day with her tremendous voice, Marija was too eager to see that others conformed to the proprieties to consider them herself.";TRUE
The Da Vinci Code;Dan Brown;Renowned curator Jacques Sauniere staggered through the vaulted archway of the museum's Grand  Gallery. He lunged for the nearest painting he could see, a Caravaggio. Grabbing the gilded frame,  the seventy-six-year-old man heaved the masterpiece toward himself until it tore from the wall and  Sauniere collapsed backward in a heap beneath the canvas.;TRUE
Persuasion;Jane Austen;"Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century";FALSE
Mansfield Park;Jane Austen;About thirty years ago Miss Maria Ward, of Huntingdon, with only seven thousand pounds, had the good luck to captivate Sir Thomas Bertram, of Mansfield Park, in the county of Northampton, and to be thereby raised to the rank of a baronet’s lady, with all the comforts and consequences of an handsome house and large income.;FALSE
Candide;Voltaire;In a castle of Westphalia, belonging to the Baron of Thunder-ten-Tronckh, lived a youth,  whom nature had endowed with the most gentle manners. His countenance was a true picture  of his soul. He combined a true judgment with simplicity of spirit, which was the reason, I apprehend, of his being called Candide. ;TRUE
For Whom the Bell Tolls;Ernest Hemingway;"He lay flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees.

Far from the Madding Crowd;Thomas Hardy;When Farmer Oak smiled, the corners of his mouth spread till they were within an unimportant distance of his ears, his eyes were reduced to mere chinks, and diverging wrinkles appeared round them, extending upon his countenance like the rays in a rudimentary sketch of the rising sun.;TRUE
The Fellowship of the Ring;J.R.R. Tolkien;When  Mr.  Bilbo  Baggins  of  Bag  End  announced  that  he would  shortly  be  celebrating  his  eleventy-first  birthday  with a  party  of  special  magnificence,  there  was  much  talk  and  excitement  in  Hobbiton. ;TRUE
The Return of the Native;Thomas Hardy;A Saturday afternoon in November was approaching the time of twilight, and the vast tract of unenclosed wild known as Egdon Heath embrowned itself moment by moment. Overhead the hollow stretch of whitish cloud shutting out the sky was as a tent which had the whole heath for its floor.;TRUE
Sons and Lovers;D.H. Lawrence;“The Bottoms” succeeded to “Hell Row”. Hell Row was a block of thatched, bulging cottages that stood by the brookside on Greenhill Lane. There lived the colliers who worked in the little gin-pits two fields away. The brook ran under the alder trees, scarcely soiled by these small mines, whose coal was drawn to the surface by donkeys that plodded wearily in a circle round a gin.;TRUE

Bleak House;Charles Dickens;London. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather.

Père Goriot;Honoré de Balzac;MADAME VATJQUER, nee de Conflans, is an old lady who for forty years has kept a second-class boarding- house in Paris, a pension bouryeoise, in the Rue Neuve Sainte-Genevieve, between the Latin quarter and the faubourg Saint-Marceau.;TRUE

The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling;Henry Fielding;"An author ought to consider himself, not as a gentleman who gives a private or eleemosynary treat, but rather as one who keeps a public ordinary, at which all persons are welcome for their money. In the former case, it is well known that the entertainer provides what fare he pleases; and though this should be very indifferent, and utterly disagreeable to the taste of his company, they must not find any fault; nay, on the contrary, good breeding forces them outwardly to approve and to commend whatever is set before them. Now the contrary of this happens to the master of an ordinary.";TRUE
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban;J.K. Rowling;Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For onething, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year.

Kim;Rudyard Kipling;He sat, in defiance of municipal orders, astride the gun Zam Zammah on her brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher—the Wonder House, as the natives call the Lahore Museum.

The Sound and the Fury;William Faulkner;Through the fence, between the curling flower spaces, I could see them hitting. They were coming toward where the flag was and I went along the fence.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire;J.K. Rowling;"The villagers of Little Hangleron still called it ""the Riddle House,"" even though it had been many years since the Riddle family had lived there.

Once a fine-looking manor, and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied.";FALSE
The Mill on the Floss;George Eliot;A wide plain, where the broadening Floss hurries on between its green banks to the sea, and the loving tide, rushing to meet it, checks its passage with an impetuous embrace.

A Wrinkle in Time;Madeleine L'Engle;IT was a dark and stormy night. In her attic bedroom Margaret Murry, wrapped in an old patchwork quilt, sat on the foot of her bed and watched the trees tossing in the frenzied lashing of the wind.

The Hound of the Baskervilles;Arthur Conan Doyle;Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated at the breakfast table.

It was a fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a “Penang lawyer.” ;TRUE
The Two Towers;J.R.R. Tolkien;Aragorn sped on up the hill. Every now and again he bent to the ground. Hobbits go light, and their footprints are not easy even for a Ranger to read, but not far from the top a spring crossed the path, and in the wet earth he saw what he was seeking.;TRUE
The War of the Worlds;H.G. Wells;"No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.";TRUE
Middlemarch;George Eliot;"Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into relief by poor dress. Her hand and wrist were so finely formed that she could wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the Blessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters; and her profile as well as her stature and bearing seemed to gain the more dignity from her plain garments";TRUE
The Age of Innocence;Edith Wharton;"On a January evening of the early seventies, Christine Nilsson was singing in Faust at the Academy of Music in New York. Though there was already talk of the erection, in remote metropolitan distances ""above the Forties,"" of a new Opera House which should compete in costliness and splendour with those of the great European capitals, the world of fashion was still content to reassemble every winter in the shabby red and gold boxes of the sociable old Academy.";FALSE
The Color Purple;Alice Walker;Whatever else The Color Purple has been taken for during the years since its publication, it remains for me the theological  work examining the journey from the religious back to the spiritual that I spent much of my adult life, prior to writing it,  seeking to avoid. Having recognized myself as a worshiper of Nature by the age of eleven, because my spirit resolutely  wandered out the window to find trees and wind during Sunday sermons, I saw no reason why, once free, I should bother  with religious matters at all.;FALSE
Northanger Abbey;Jane Austen;No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be an heroine.

On the Road;Jack Kerouac;I first met Dean not long after my wife and I split up. I had just gotten over a serious illness that I won’t bother to talk about, except that it had something to do with the miserably weary split-up and my feeling that everything was dead. With the coming of Dean Moriarty began the part of my life you could call my life on the road. Before that I’d often dreamed of going West to see the country, always vaguely planning and never taking off.;TRUE
Catch-22;Joseph Heller;It was love at first sight. The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him. Yossarian was in the hospital with a pain in his liver that fell just short of being jaundice. The doctors were puzzled by the fact that it wasn’t quite jaundice. If it became jaundice they could treat it.;TRUE
Around the World in Eighty Days;Jules Verne;"Mr. Phileas Fogg lived, in 1872, at No. 7, Saville Row, Burlington Gardens, the house in which Sheridan died in 1814.

Hard Times;Charles Dickens;‘Now, what I want is, Facts.  Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts.  Facts alone are wanted in life.  Plant nothing else, and root out everything else.  You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon Facts: nothing else will ever be of any service to them.  This is the principle on which I bring up my own children, and this is the principle on which I bring up these children.  Stick to Facts, sir!’;TRUE
Beloved;Toni Morrison;124 WAS SPITEFUL. Full of a baby's venom. The women in the house knew it and so did the children. For years each put up with the spite in his own way, but by 1873 Sethe and her daughter Denver were its only victims.;FALSE
Mrs. Dalloway;Virginia Woolf;"Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself. For Lucy had her work cut out for her. The doors would be taken off their hinges; Rumpelmayer's men were coming. And then, thought Clarissa Dalloway, what a morning—fresh as if issued to children on a beach.";FALSE
To the Lighthouse;Virginia Woolf;"""Yes, of course, if it's fine tomorrow,"" said Mrs Ramsay. ""But you'll have to be up with the lark,"" she added. To her son these words conveyed an extraordinary joy, as if it were settled, the expedition were bound to take place, and the wonder to which he had looked forward, for years and years it seemed, was, after a night's darkness and a day's sail, within touch.";FALSE
The Magician's Nephew;C.S. Lewis;This is a story about something that happened long ago when your grandfather was a child. It is a very important story because it shows how all the comings and goings between our own world and the land of Narnia first began.;TRUE
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix;J.K. Rowling;"The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing; the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought.";FALSE
The Sun Also Rises;Ernest Hemingway;Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton. Do not think that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it meant a lot to Cohn. He cared nothing for boxing, in fact he disliked it, but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton.;TRUE
The Good Earth;Pearl S. Buck;IT WAS WANG LUNG'S MARRIAGE DAY.

Silas Marner;George Eliot;In the days when the spinning-wheels hummed busily in the farmhouses—and even great ladies, clothed in silk and thread-lace, had their toy spinning-wheels of polished oak—there might be seen in districts far away among the lanes, or deep in the bosom of the hills, certain pallid undersized men, who, by the side of the brawny country-folk, looked like the remnants of a disinherited race.;TRUE
Love in the Time of Cholera;Gabriel García Márquez;IT WAS INEVITABLE: the scent of bitter almonds always reminded him of the fate of unrequited love. Dr. Juvenal Urbino noticed it as soon as he entered the still darkened house where he had hurried on an urgent call to attend a case that for him had lost all urgency many years before.;TRUE
Rebecca;Daphne Du Maurier;Last night I dreamt  went to Manderley again. It seemed to  me I stood by the iron gate leading to the drive, and for a while I could not enter, for the way was barred to me. There was a padlock and a chain upon the gate. I called in my dream to tfie lodge-keeper, and had no answer, and peering closer tlirough  the rusted spokes of the^ate I saw that the lodge was uninhabited. ;FALSE
Jude the Obscure;Thomas Hardy;The schoolmaster was leaving the village, and everybody seemed sorry. The miller at Cresscombe lent him the small white tilted cart and horse to carry his goods to the city of his destination, about twenty miles off, such a vehicle proving of quite sufficient size for the departing teacher’s effects. For the schoolhouse had been partly furnished by the managers, and the only cumbersome article possessed by the master;TRUE
Twilight;Stephenie Meyer;I'd never given much thought to how I would die — though I'd had reason enough in the last few months — but even if I had, I would not have imagined it like this. ;FALSE
A Passage to India;E.M. Forster;Except for the Marabar Caves—and they are twenty miles off—the city of Chandrapore presents nothing extraordinary. Edged rather than washed by the river Ganges, it trails for a couple of miles along the bank, scarcely distinguishable from the rubbish it deposits so freely. There are no bathing-steps on the river front, as the Ganges happens not to be holy here;TRUE
The Plague;Albert Camus;"MOTHER died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I can’t be sure. The telegram from the Home says: YOUR MOTHER PASSED AWAY. FUNERAL TOMORROW. DEEP SYMPATHY. Which leaves the matter doubtful; it could have been yesterday.";TRUE
Nicholas Nickleby;Charles Dickens;There once lived, in a sequestered part of the county of Devonshire, one Mr. Godfrey Nickleby: a worthy gentleman, who, taking it into his head rather late in life that he must get married, and not being young enough or rich enough to aspire to the hand of a lady of fortune, had wedded an old flame out of mere attachment, who in her turn had taken him for the same reason. Thus two people who cannot afford to play cards for money, sometimes sit down to a quiet game for love;TRUE
The Pearl;John Steinbeck;Kino awakened in the near dark. The stars still shone and the day had drawn only a pale wash of light in the lower sky to the east. The roosters had been crowing for some time, and the early pigs were already beginning their ceaseless turning of twigs and bits of wood to see whether anything to eat had been overlooked. Outside the brush house in the tuna clump, a covey of little birds chittered and flurried with their wings.;TRUE
Ethan Frome;Edith Wharton;The village lay under two feet of snow, with drifts at the windy corners. In a sky of iron the points of the Dipper hung like icicles and Orion flashed his cold fires. The moon had set, but the night was so transparent that the white house-fronts between the elms looked gray against the snow, clumps of bushes made black stains on it, and the basement windows of the church sent shafts of yellow light far across the endless undulations.;FALSE
The Tale of Genji;Murasaki Shikibu;"AT the Court of an Emperor (he lived it matters not when) there was among the many gentlewomen of the Wardrobe and Chamber one, who though she was not of very high rank was favoured far beyond all the rest; so that the great ladies of the Palace, each of whom had secretly hoped that she herself would be chosen, looked with scorn and hatred upon the upstart who had dispelled their dreams.";FALSE
The Giver;Lois Lowry;It was almost December, and Jonas was beginning to be frightened. No. Wrong word, Jonas thought.

Robinson Crusoe;Daniel Defoe;I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family, though not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at Hull.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest;Ken Kesey;They’re out there. Black boys in white suits up before me to commit sex acts in the hall and get it mopped up before I can catch them.
