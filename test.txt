__label__<TRUE>	<The little town of Verrires can pass for one of the prettiest in Franche-Comt. Its white houses with their pointed red-tiled roofs stretch along the slope of a hill; whose slightest undulations are marked by groups of vigorous chestnuts. The Doubs flows to within some hundred feet above its fortifications; which were built long ago by the Spaniards; and are now in ruins>	
__label__<TRUE>	<Mother died today. Or; maybe; yesterday; I cant be sure. The telegram from the Home says: your MOTHER PASSED AWAY. FUNERAL TOMORROW. DEEP sympathy. Which leaves the matter doubtful; it could have been yesterday>	
__label__<TRUE>	<Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K.; he knew he had done nothing wrong but; one morning; he was arrested. Every day at eight in the morning he was brought his breakfast by Mrs. Grubachs cook Mrs. Grubach was his landlady but today she didnt come. That had never happened before.

__label__<TRUE>	<Ours is essentially a tragic age; so we refuse to take it tragically. The cataclysm has happened; we are among the ruins; we start to build up new little habitats; to have new little hopes. It is rather hard work: there is now no smooth road into the future: but we go round; or scramble over the obstacles. Weve got to live; no matter how many skies have fallen>	
__label__<TRUE>	<I will begin the story of my adventures with a certain morning early in the month of June; the year of grace 1751; when I took the key for the last time out of the door of my fathers house. The sun began to shine upon the summit of the hills as I went down the road; and by the time I had come as far as the manse; the blackbirds were whistling in the garden lilacs; and the mist that hung around the valley in the time of the dawn was beginning to arise and die away>	
__label__<TRUE>	<If you really want to hear about it; the first thing youll probably want to know is where I was born; an what my lousy childhood was like; and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me; and all that David Copperfield kind of crap; but I dont feel like going into it; if you want to know the truth. In the first place; that stuff bores me; and in the second place; my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them>	
__label__<TRUE>	<IT WAS A PLEASURE TO BURN. IT was a special pleasure to see things eaten; to see things blackened and changed. With the brass nozzle in his fists; with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world; the blood pounded in his head; and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history>	
__label__<TRUE>	<Looking back to all that has occurred to me since that eventful day; I am scarcely able to believe in the reality of my adventures. They were truly so wonderful that even now I am bewildered when I think of them>	
__label__<FALSE>	<Scarlett OHara was not beautiful; but men seldom realized it when caught by her charm as the Tarleton twins were.

But it was an arresting face; pointed of chin; square of jaw>	
__label__<FALSE>	<LAST summer I happened to be crossing the plains of Iowa in a season of intense heat; and it was my good fortune to have for a traveling companion James Quayle Burden--Jim Burden; as we still call him in the West. He and I are old friends--we grew up together in the same Nebraska town--and we had much to say to each other. While the train flashed through neverending miles of ripe wheat; by country towns and bright-flowered pastures and oak groves wilting in the sun; we sat in the observation car>	
__label__<TRUE>	<A FEW MILES south of Soledad; the Salinas River drops in close to the hillside bank and runs deep and green. The water is warm too; for it has slipped twinkling over the yellow sands in the sunlight before reaching the narrow pool. On one side of the river the golden foothill slopes curve up to the strong and rocky Gabilan mountains>	
__label__<TRUE>	<I was ever of opinion; that the honest man who married and brought up a large family; did more service than he who continued single; and only talked of population.

__label__<TRUE>	<Camelot Camelot; said I to myself. I don't seem to remember hearing of it before. Name of the asylum; likely. It was a soft; reposeful summer landscape; as lovely as a dream; and as lonesome as Sunday. The air was full of the smell of flowers; and the buzzing of insects; and the twittering of birds; and there were no people; no wagons; there was no stir of life; nothing going on>	
__label__<TRUE>	<In this masterly unromantic novel; Turgenev drew a character; Bazarov; who served to express what he taught us to call Nihilism; and made a movement into a man. In Russia itself the effect of the story was astonishing. The portrait of Bazarov was immediately and angrily resented as a cold travesty. The portraits of the backwoodsmen; or retired aristocrats; fared no better. Turgenev had indeed roused the ire of both sides; only too surely>

__label__<TRUE>	<It was four oclock when the ceremony was over and the carriages began to arrive. There had been a crowd following all the way; owing to the exuberance of Marija Berczynskas. The occasion rested heavily upon Marijas broad shoulders--it was her task to see that all things went in due form; and after the best home traditions; and; flying wildly hither and thither; bowling every one out of the way; and scolding and exhorting all day with her tremendous voice; Marija was too eager to see that others conformed to the proprieties to consider them herself>	
__label__<TRUE>	<Renowned curator Jacques Sauniere staggered through the vaulted archway of the museums Grand  Gallery. He lunged for the nearest painting he could see; a Caravaggio.

__label__<TRUE>	<He lay flat on the brown; pine-needled floor of the forest; his chin on his folded arms; and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees.

__label__<FALSE>	<You took off your waistband; you tore off your sandals; you pulled your wide skirt; cotton; to one corner; it seems to me; and you let go the knot that held your hair in a tail.
