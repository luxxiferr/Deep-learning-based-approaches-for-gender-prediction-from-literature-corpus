Predicting author's gender with Spacy, Flair and Transformers

Author profiling consists on obtain information about the author. In this paper, we address this task from the perspective of gender detection in literature books from different authors and literature periods. For doing this, we have used Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, specifically three of them, to compare the results and obtain the best one (Spacy, Flair and Transformers). The results obtained do not show a big difference between these methods and they, also, are poor results with low accuracy, compared to other papers. In conclusion, it is difficult for the different sequence classification methods to obtain information about the author just taking by features the stilometric style with low quantities of data.
For Spacy we used the corpus name authors_corpus (1) (1).csv.
For Flair we used the splits in Fast Text format.
For the Transformer's Notebook we used the split: train.csv and test.csv with 0's and 1's labels.
